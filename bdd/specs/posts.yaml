description: >
  Post: a piece of text (and possible attachments) posted by an user, possibly
  in reply to another Post. Always part of exactly one Conversation, may be the
  Conversation's starting point (OP) or a reply.

specs:
- feature: create posts
  scenarios:
  - name: data is required
    when:
    - I make a new post with no title and which is not a reply
    then:
    - It fails, telling me I must provide more data
  - name: Anonymous posting
    notes: >
      This scenario is specific to the current prototype, and will not be part
      of the actual product later, as we plan to require login before posting.
      However, for now there's no auth, so we just allow posters to identify
      themselves free-form.
    when:
    - I make a new post and don't provide an author name
    then:
    - My new post is created
    - The author display name is "Anonymous Coward"
  - name: Identified posting
    notes: >
      Since there's no auth yet, this is currently faked by the test suite by
      looking up the user in the context and passing in the correct
      authorDisplayName.
    given:
    - I'm authenticated as test-user-2-bob
    when:
    - I make a new post
    then:
    - My new post is created

  scenarios:

    when:

  - name: fetch thread
    when:
    - I fetch the thread from test-post-1
    then:
    - I get 7 posts
  - name: fetch partial thread
    when:
    - I fetch the thread from test-post-1 after test-post-3
    then:
    - I get 4 posts
  - name: fetch by date
    when:
    - I fetch the thread from test-post-1 since 2019-05-30T16:11:50
